### Hi, I'm Kyle 👋

I'm a software engineer at Retail Insights LLC, where we work with fortune 10 pharmaceutical  wholesalers to build them tools for the drug manufacturers they wholesale for. Some of those tools include New Product Setup, Compliance Form Handling across multiple avenues, national tradeshow registration systems, request for quote bidding, product pricing maintenance and *much much much* more.

On my own time, I enjoy building projects in Laravel using the [TALL](https://tallstack.dev/) stack. I'm the creator of [songrank.dev](https://songrank.dev) 🎵 & [sdp-tracker.com](https://sdp-tracker.com) 📊 with many more projects that I haven't released yet.

I also stream programming and video game content over on [twitch](https://twitch.tv/spacelampsix), come drop in and see what I'm working on live!
